# Bitcoin Time Series Analysis & Prediction
The purpose of this repository is to practice time series analysis & visualisations using Bitcoin data as well as a brief prediction at the end.

Techniques & indicators used in this analysis include:
- Shifting & Lags
- Simple Moving Average
- Exponential Moving Average
- Relative Strength Index
- Price Momentum
- Rates of Change
- Time Series decomposition

The prediction was completed using an XGBoost Regressor which did well to capture the declines in the Bitcoin close price, but struggled detecting the high peaks.
